# can i drink yet

a site to let you know if you're old enough to drink in a given location

To start the app locally (in dev mode), clone the app and then

```bash
cd can-i-drink-yet
npm install # or yarn!
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site running on the dev server (3000 is the default port which can be changed if needed).
